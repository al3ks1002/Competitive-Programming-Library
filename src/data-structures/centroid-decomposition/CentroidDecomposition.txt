You are given a tree with N (<= 10^5) vertices.
Initially, vertex 1 is red. The rest of the vertices are blue.
You are then given M operations:
1 x - color the x vertex in red
2 x - print the smallest distance from x to a red vertex

Input format:
N M
N - 1 lines representing the edges of the tree
M lines representing operations

Ouput format:
lines representing the answer to the operations of type 2
