You are given a matrix with N (<= 10^3) rows and M (<= 10^3) columns, where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
Q (<= 10^5) operations are being performed:
0 a b c d - get the sum from submatrix with upper-left corner in (a, b) and lower-right corner in (c, d);
1 a b c - add c in cell (a,b) (c <= 10^9).
All the matrix coordinates are valid.

Input format:
N M Q
N lines, each with M elements, representing the matrix
Q lines representing the operations

Output format:
The answers for the queries of type 0
