You are given N (<=10^5) and M (<=2*10^5).
An array of N numbers (with values <= 10^4) follows.
Then M queries are given:
0 a b - add value b to the a-th element in the array
1 a b - get the sum from [a, b]
2 a - find the first position k such that sum(1, k) == a, -1 if it doesn't exist

Input format:
N M
N values representing the array
M lines representing queries

Output format:
the answers for the queries
