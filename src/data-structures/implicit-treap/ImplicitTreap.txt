You have a null sequence. The sequence is 1 based.

M operations are being performed:
- I k e - insert e at index k;
  Elements that were on indexes >= k are being shifted one position to the right;
  1 <= k <= sequence_size + 1; e <= 10^9;
- A k - print the element from index k;
- R i j - reverse subsequence [i, j] (i <= j);
 -D i j - delete subsequence [i, j] (i <= j).

At the end you need to print the sequence.

Input format:
M
M lines representing the operations

Output format:
Lines representing the answers for queries of type A
A line representing the sequence at the end
