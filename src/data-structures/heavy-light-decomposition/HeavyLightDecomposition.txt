You are given a tree with N vertices (<= 100k), each vertex having a value (<= 2e9).
You are also given M (<= 100k) operations:
0 x y - update the value of vertex x with y
1 x y - get the max value from the chain from x - y

Input format:
N M
a line containing N values representing the vertices values
M lines representing the operations

Output format:
Lines representing the answers for the queries of type 1
