You are given a tree with N (<= 100k) vertices and M (<= 100k) queries.
Each query contains two vertices: x, y. You need to print the LCA(x, y).

Input format:
N M
N - 1 numbers, f[i] representing the father of the i + 1 vertex, i e [1, N]
M lines representing the queries

Output format:
M lines representing the LCAs
