You are given a directed graph with N (<= 50k) vertices and M (<= 250k) edges.
You need to print the minimum distance from 1 to vertices 2,3,...,N.
If there is a negative cycle, you need to print "Ciclu negativ!".
It is guaranteed that there is a path from 1 to every vertex from the graph.

Input format:
N M
M lines representing the edges (abs(cost) <= 1000)

Output format:
N - 1 values representing the distances or "Ciclu negativ!"
