You are given a connected weighted undirected graph with N (<= 200k) vertices
and M (<= 400k) edges. Each edge has a cost between -1000 and 1000.
You have to find the cost of the minimum spanning tree.

Input format:
N M
M lines representing the edges(to from cost)

Output format:
cost - the cost of the mst
