You are given a tree with N (<= 10^5) vertices. Each vertex x has a color: c[x] (<= N).
For each vertex, you need to print the sum of all dominating colors.
A color c is dominating for vertex v if there are no other colors
that appear in the subtree of vertex v more times than colour c.

Input format:
N
A line with N numbers representing the colors.
N - 1 lines representing edges from the tree.

Output format:
N numbers representing the answer for each vertex.
