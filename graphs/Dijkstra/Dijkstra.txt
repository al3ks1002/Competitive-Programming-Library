You are given a directed graph with N vertices (<= 50.000) and M edges(<= 250.000).
Edges have costs (<= 20.000).

You have to find the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices.
If a vertex is unreachable, the distance is considered 0.

Input format:
N M
M lines representing the edges (x y cost).

Output format:
dist[2] dist[3] ... dist[N]
