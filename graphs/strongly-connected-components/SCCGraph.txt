You are given a directed graph with N (<= 100k) vertices and M (<= 200k) edges.
You need to find it's strongly connected components.
Every component must be sorted separately and then the components must be sorted
(if a component has minimum vertex x and another component has minimum vertex y,
with x < y, then the first component must be printed first).

Input format:
N M
M lines representing the edges (x y)

Output format:
ans - number of components
ans lines representing the components
