Given a graph with N (<= 10^5) vertices and M (<= 2 * 10^5) edges, print its biconnected components (considering articulation points).

Input format:
N M
M lines representing the edges

Output format:
First line: X - number of biconnected components.
X lines representing the components: each component has its vertices sorted, and the components are sorted by vertices (e.g. "2 5 6" appears before "5 6 9").
